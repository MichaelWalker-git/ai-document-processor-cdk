## Overview

The **Intelligent Processing Project** is a React-based client application that leverages TypeScript for type safety and Vite for fast builds and development. Biome is used for code formatting and linting, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. This project aims to provide an efficient and seamless experience for intelligent data processing tasks.

## Features

- **Modern UI:** Built with React to provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Type Safety:** Ensures robust code with TypeScript.
- **Lightning-fast Development:** Vite powers the development server for instant feedback.
- **Code Quality:** Enforced by Biome, providing consistent formatting and linting.
- **Extensibility:** Designed for scalability and integration with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Biome](https://biome.dev/)
